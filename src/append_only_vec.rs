//! # **AppendOnlyVec** - *Contiguous concurrent append-only Vec*
//!
//! Storage is a single contiguous allocation sized at construction.
//! The buffer is never reallocated, so element addresses remain stable
//! for the vector's lifetime. `Dictionary` can therefore hand out `&str`
//! borrows tied to `&self` against the published prefix without any
//! reader-side lock or guard.
//!
//! ## Concurrency model
//! - **Reads**: wait-free. `as_slice`, `get`, and `iter` observe the
//!   published prefix `[0, published)` using an `Acquire` load of the
//!   publish counter, then read directly from the contiguous buffer.
//!   Readers never inspect reserved-but-unpublished slots.
//!
//! - **Writes**: concurrent, with a lock-free reservation phase and an
//!   ordered, blocking publication phase. A writer first claims a slot
//!   using a cap-bounded `compare_exchange_weak` loop on `reserved`,
//!   then writes the value into that exclusively-owned slot. To preserve
//!   a contiguous readable prefix, writers publish in reservation order:
//!   each writer waits until all lower-indexed slots have been published,
//!   then advances `published` with a `Release` store.
//!
//! No mutex is taken on the read or write path. However, `push` as a
//! whole is not lock-free: if a writer is paused after reserving a slot
//! but before publishing it, later writers must wait for that predecessor
//! before they can publish.
//!
//! ## Capacity
//! Capacity is fixed at construction. `push` returns `None` once the
//! pre-allocated cap is reached. The cap check is inside the `reserved`
//! CAS loop, so the configured capacity is honoured exactly, including
//! under heavy multi-writer contention. A failed CAS never advances
//! `reserved`, so no slot is leaked.
